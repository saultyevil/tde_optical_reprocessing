# Reprocessing in optically thick outflows can produce the optical emission line spectra of tidal disruption events

Provided are the parameter files, the synthetic spectra and physical parameters
of the wind, for the models shown in the paper.

We also include some of the scripts used to generate the figures. Not all
of the scripts are included here due to them requiring data which was not
generated by ourselves, or where it is not practical to include the data in this
repository, due to, i.e., large file sizes. The scripts have been modified to
work with the directory structure, but hasn't been tested extensively.

In `scripts`, there is a directory named `pypython`. This is a Python package
which is used by the scripts to create the figures. The main repository, where
some documentation is kept, for this package is
[https://github.com/saultyevil/pypython](https://github.com/saultyevil/pypython).
Any issues with this package, please report them on the relevant GitHub page.
